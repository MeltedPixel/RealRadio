About XPlaneConnect:

The X-Plane Connect (XPC) Toolbox is an open source research tool used to
interact with the commercial flight simulator software X-Plane. XPC allows users
to control aircraft and receive state information from aircraft simulated in
X-Plane using functions written in C, C++, Java, MATLAB, or Python in real time over the
network. This research tool has been used to visualize flight paths, test control
algorithms, simulate an active airspace, or generate out-the-window visuals for
in-house flight simulation software. Possible applications include active control
of an XPlane simulation, flight visualization, recording states during a flight,
or interacting with a mission over UDP.
